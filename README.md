# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to review fundraising results for plays based on launch dates and goals into order to choose the best launch date and goal for Louises play Fever

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for theater is gathered in a pivot table and displayed as an graph (see Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png). This does not include campaigns in progress.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The number and percentage of successful and failed campaigns for plays was gathered in a table and displayed as a graph (see Outcomes_vs_Goals.png). This does not include cancelled (no campaigns for plays were cancelled) or in progress.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The data for outcomes based on goals is no further broken down past $50,000. Also, Kickstarter campaigns require a goal amount, but some of the lower numbers ($10 goals) might indicate a nominal amount and not reflect the actual cost or goal for a campaign.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Campaigns launched in May were most likely to be successful. Campaigns were less successful in each following month.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Generally, lower goals were more likely to succeed. However, goals from $35,000-$44,999 also show greater success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data for outcomes based on goals is no further broken down past $50,000. Also, Kickstarter campaigns require a goal amount, but some of the lower numbers ($10 goals) might indicate a nominal amount and not reflect the actual cost or goal for a campaign. This data also does not break down successes based on play genre, which might be a better indicator of success.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Amount raised based on the month the campaign started and amount raised based on goal. What is the correlation between the amount raised and the goal displayed?
